* Tasks
** TODO Finish off sprite rendering and the renderer.
  - Make API so that pushing a command accepts any buffer, not
    just the frame data buffer in CommandBuffer
  - Command buffer should contain two arrays of commands for
    double buffering. Should increment a semaphore when
    submitting a command, which the render function waits on.
  - Read/Write locks for controlling swap while write? Or that
    "reverse semaphore"
  - Switch to POD atomic.
** TODO GameApi struct that contains function pointers
   - FPs for when the game starts and finishes, and when it's updating.
** TODO Clean up the code a bit
